### Why?
Cause it adds hierarchy and structure to a text. That's what HTML is for. So we need to know how.

### What is "semantics" ?
Well I tell you.

>A sentence is a series of words. A title is also a series of words. And so is a subtitle. How can a computer know which is >which? Semantics is about marking up what a series of information is to be considered as. It adds hierarchy and structure to a >text. That's what HTML is for.

### Why is semantics so important ?
Two reasons : SEO (your website's findability / visibility on Google) and Accessibility (make sure all humans, no matter their handicap (blindness, poor eyesight, colorblindness) can access the information.

### Is it easy to use semantics? 
Sure it is!
Semantics consists in choosing the right **tags** and **attributes** to represent your content. Do keep in mind that too much semantics hurts semantics. The rule (as often in programming) is: **as little code as possible, but as much as necessary.**

### So whudup with this task?
We needed to translate this txt document into semantic html, using the right html tags : h1, h2, blockquote, q, img, p, hr, figure and caption, table, th, tr, td, ul or ol andli.

So yeah, I did what they asked for!
Enjoy
