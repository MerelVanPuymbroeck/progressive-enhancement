    <h2>The story</h2>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,<span class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</span> The farmer said <span class="farmer"> “Maybe.” </span>
      The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <span class="farmer"> “Maybe.” </span> “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</span> The farmer again said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong>
      The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <span class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</span> and the farmer responded, <span class="farmer">“Maybe.”</span>
      The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said<span class="villagers">,“Isn’t that great!”</span> Again, he said, <span class="farmer">“Maybe.”</span>
      The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <!--2nd level heading (nested within one sectioning element-->
    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
